                When it comes to purchasing books for courses in college it can really drain your wallet. Books

                in college are expensive in addition to college tuition. Almost every student can relate to this

                issue. Trying to buy used books is an option that many students choose because of the lower

                prices, but getting the books for free is priceless - literally. That is why our team of four: Hannah

                Roper, Taylor Hincks, Eric Schrock, and Daniel Neri are proposing to create a website where

                students can upload books and/or obtain books by purchasing them or getting them for free. The

                website that we will create will target students from IUPUI. The content of the website will

                consist of a library where students can sell, buy, lend, and/or give away books of courses that

                they have taken. College books are expensive, but with the help of this website, students who

                cannot afford buying new books can find cheaper or even free books from other fellow students.

                This website will also benefit students who would like to gain some money by selling their books

                to other students who may be needing it.
